# Optimization-of-Office-Supplies-Management_Power-BI
To help the company make data-driven decisions about how to efficiently manage its office supplies using Power BI

# Challenges:
The organisation has multiple offices, warehouses, and employees who need a variety of office supplies to perform their tasks efficiently.
**Supply Variability:** Different offices and departments have varying supply requirements, leading to challenges in estimating how much of each supply is needed.
**Procurement Costs:** Procuring office supplies without a data-driven strategy results in high procurement costs. Often, they miss out on bulk discounts and end up
                       ordering items they already have in abundance.
**Inventory Space:** Storage space has become a concern, as managing a vast array of supplies efficiently requires proper space allocation and inventory management.
**Productivity Impact:** When employees run out of essential supplies, their productivity is affected as they need to spend time requesting new supplies or locating 
                         existing ones.
